📊 Power BI Dashboard – Business Performance & Inventory Management
📌 Project Description

This Power BI dashboard provides a complete overview of business performance and inventory management for a retail company following a Just-In-Time model.

The dashboard is designed to help business leaders, operations teams, and supply chain managers understand:

How sales and profits are performing over time

Which products and departments are driving orders

How inventory levels and storage costs are impacting the business

How efficiently orders are fulfilled and shipped

The focus is on decision-making, not technical complexity — all insights are presented visually using charts, KPIs, and filters.

🧭 Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is divided into two main sections:

Business Performance

Inventory Management

Each section answers different but connected business questions.
